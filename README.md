# Shopciafa
Shopciafa is the online shop application using face detection technology and the first application that lists the most suitable products according to the age and gender of the person.

## What is Shopciafa
The word "Shopciafa" was derived by combining the words shop and faccia. Faccia is an Italian word and it means face. Because the aim is designed an online shop application using face detection technology. 

Every person is private and they want to look beautiful both for themselves and those around them. Therefore, people go shopping and try to find the most suitable products for them. Technology is developing rapidly and becoming a part of our lives. People spend most of their time on phones and tablets. Most of the work can be done easily at the push of a button. One of them is undoubtedly shopping. Online shopping sites provide a great convenience for people who are in busy business pace, who do not like crowds, or who do not want to waste time walking around in stores. In this project, it is aimed to develop an application that will make it easier for users to find the product they are looking for.

Women shop more than men. For this reason, when you log into most online shopping sites, firstly women's products (clothes, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, etc.) are shown. In this project, the products that appear on the home page will be different for everyone. The user will log into the account and the userâ€™s picture should be uploaded to the profile page within the app. Nobody can see this picture except the user.  The purpose of uploading a picture is to determine the person's gender and age. In line with this information, the products on the main page of the application will be the most suitable products for the user. When a male user enters the application, he will come across men's categories and products. When a female user enters the application, she will see women's products and categories. Besides, the person's age will be determined in the application. When a young person enters the system, he/she will see the products suitable for young fashion, and a middle-aged person will encounter age-appropriate products.
